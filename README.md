Parcel Typescript Vue
=====================

I've been trying to figure out how to get type checked templates into my code for quite some time.

This is an experiment with some of the latest tools to see if I can get compiler errors using Vue.js,
Typescript, and Parcel.

Current Issues
----

  1. Intrinsic Elements not showing all sub components.
  2. JSX not being checked for correctness.
  3. Type errors everywhere.
